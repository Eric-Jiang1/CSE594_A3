These products will incorporate one or several of the following technologies: DSL, Routers, 802.11 Wireless, VPN, Firewalls.\u00a0\u00a0The primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight. The individual manages the ODM to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems. In addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the ODM. Within the service provider group, another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers. The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors.\u00a0A word from the Recruiter:\u00a0\"Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched,\u00a0our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions.\u00a0In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members,\u00a0once they do the first project they want more and more.\u00a0As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door.\"\u00a0\"Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like : I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here. \u00a0Here, the\u00a0PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product,\u00a0including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from,\u00a0this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope.\u00a0The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity.\"\u00a0This is what not shared on the JD.\u00a0\"How you will mature your career.\"\u00a0Job Responsibilities:\u00a0\u2022 For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.
